Session based authentication is one in which the user state is stored on the serverâ€™s memory. When using a session based auth system, the server creates and stores the session data in the server memory when the user logs in and then stores the session Id in a cookie on the user browser.
The session Id is then sent on subsequent requests to the server and the server compares it with the stored session data and proceeds to process the requested action.
